					<h1>The Story of Vincentâ€™s Sphere</h1>
				</div>

				<p>
					Hi, I am Mauli Rahman. I am a Business Student by choice and an Art
					Enthusiast by talent. Also, I am a scented candle freak. But scented
					candles were rare in Bangladesh. I remember buying candle-making kits
					and make some candles at home for myself and my friends & family. That
					is when I thought of turning my passion into a business
				</p>
				<p>
					At the end of 2019, I started my journey of Vincent's Sphere. I
					started small, only with 30 candles to be exact, and which sold out
					just within 2 days. Ever since then, there was no looking back. As we
					are growing, I got my two best friends on board with me to deal with
					the now increased workload. Flash forward to now, Vincents's Sphere is
					a full-fledged brand of Scented Candles, Skincare, and Handmade Goods
					loved by all.
