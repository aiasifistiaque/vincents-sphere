					Vincent's Sphere is your #1 stop for all kinds of Handcrafted Goodies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vincent's Sphere is the brainchild of Mauli Rahman, an artist and an
					art enthusiast, and a long time admirer of the famous Dutch painter
					Vincent van Gogh. She founded Vincent's Sphere with the goal of
					sharing her arts & crafts with the world and expanding her horizons as
					an artist.
				</p>
				<p>Vincent's Sphere believes in CRAFTING HAPPINESS FOR ALL.</p>
				<p>
					Vincent's Sphere is best known for its exquisite collection of
					Handcrafted Scented Candles. They have by far the largest collection
					of the most exquisite fragrances & designs bordering on innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Soon afterwards, Vincent's Sphere started to increase their line of
					handcrafted products with the release of Bath Salts, Satin Masks &
					Scrunchies, Handmade Soaps & Scrubs, Dream Catchers, Patters Papers &
					many more.
